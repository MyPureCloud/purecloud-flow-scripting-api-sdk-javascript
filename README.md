# purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript
This is the Architect scripting repository that has the built Architect-Scripting package which lets you create, checkin and publish Architect flows programmatically via. JavaScript. Architect Scripting does not have parity with what you can do in Architect's UI at this time but it is extensive for flow creation. If you really want to have just the Architect scripting framework installed, we have instructions on how to do it here but odds are this isn't what you're looking for.
